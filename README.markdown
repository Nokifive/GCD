Features
========

GCD is a lightweight Cocoa wrapper aiming at easing development with Grand Central Dispatch.
It does support some common usage patterns, it does not wrap the whole functionality; a basic understanding of how CGD works is necessary and is not addressed on this document.

## GCDQueue ##

Easily create you own queues, or access global ones

	+ (GCDQueue*)serial:(NSString*)name;
	+ (GCDQueue*)concurrent:(NSString*)name;

	+ (GCDQueue*)main;
	+ (GCDQueue*)queue;
	+ (GCDQueue*)high;
	+ (GCDQueue*)low;
	+ (GCDQueue*)background;

Set the target queue, suspend or resume execution

	- (void)setTarget:(GCDQueue*)q;
	- (void)suspend;
	- (void)resume;

Queue blocks for execution (optionally delayed or repeated) or set a barrier to synchronize concurrent ones

	- (void)add:(dispatch_block_t)block;
	- (void)add:(dispatch_block_t)block delay:(float)t;
	- (void)add:(dispatch_block_repeated_t)block times:(NSUInteger)times;
	- (void)barrier:(dispatch_block_t)block;

Context information can be set and retrieved through Obj-C subscripting from the queue. objectForKey: retrieves context from the current queue so it can be used from a block without external references.

	- (void)setObject:(id)anObject forKeyedSubscript:(id)aKey;
	- (id)objectForKeyedSubscript:(id)aKey;
	+ (id)objectForKey:(id)aKey;

## GCDGroup ##

Create, label, suspend, resume or clear a group with a comfortable syntax.

	+ (GCDGroup*)group;
	@property (nonatomic,readwrite,strong) NSString* label;
	- (void)suspend;
	- (void)resume;
	- (void)empty;

You can choose to add blocks to a specific queue, or they will be added to the global queue.

	- (void)add:(dispatch_block_t)block;
	- (void)add:(dispatch_block_t)block queue:(GCDQueue*)queue;

To manage a block execution you can set a notification block to be executed when previously submitted blocks have executed, or wait synchronously for termination.

	- (void)notify:(dispatch_block_t)block;
	- (void)notify:(dispatch_block_t)block target:(GCDQueue*)queue;
